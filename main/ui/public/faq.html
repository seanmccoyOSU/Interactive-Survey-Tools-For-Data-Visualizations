<h1>FAQ</h1>

<h4 id="1">What is this tool?</h4>
<p>This is a platform for creating, publishing, and collecting survey responses enhanced by interactive visualizations. It allows creators to design custom survey questions, from multiple choice to clickable sections on images, and then share them through a unique link.</p>

<h4 id="2">What is a visualization?</h4>
<p>A visualization is an image that the survey taker can interact with in some way. This might be selectable regions of the image, or it might be as simple as panning or zooming in and out of the image.</p>

<h4 id="3">What is a survey design?</h4>
<p>A survey design is a series of questions put together that acts as a template from which surveys can be published from. The survey design is not publicly available and can only be interacted with by the survey designer.</p>

<h4 id="4">What is a published survey?</h4>
<p>A published survey is a survey design that has been pushed out and can now be taken by users it is shared with. It is not editable. To release a changed version, the original design must be changed and a new survey must be published.</p>

<h4 id="5">How do I publish a survey?</h4>
<p>A survey must be published through a survey design. To publish a survey design, scroll to the bottom of its overview page and click 'publish.'</p>

<h4 id="6">How can I share a survey?</h4>
<p>Once you publish a survey, you will be provided with a link to the survey. You can send this out to participants via email or any other communication medium to have users take your survey.</p>

<h4 id="7">What is the format of a survey?</h4>
<p>A survey starts with a page presenting its title and introduction text. Then, it has a page for each question which a participant must navigate through one-by-one. After the last question, the conclusion text is presented.</p>

<h4 id="8">How is the title different from the name?</h4>
<p>The title of the survey is what the participant sees when they take it. The name of the survey is only seen on the designer account.</p>

<h4 id="9">How is a question displayed?</h4>
<p>On the left side of the page will be the attached visualization (if there is one). On the right side will be the question, the response prompt/field, and a comment box (if included).</p>

<h4 id="10">What is the question type?</h4>
<p>The question type is the format in which a participant responds to the question.</p>

<h4 id="11">What is a survey comment?</h4>
<p>A survey comment is an optional response section for a user to add any comments they may have about a specific survey question.</p>

<h4 id="12">What does it mean for a question to be required?</h4>
<p>A participant must leave a response in order to continue, and the response must match the min/max parameters (if they exist). To disable a min/max, set it to 0.</p>

<h4 id="13">What does it mean to import a visualization?</h4>
<p>A visualization from your account may be selected and attached to the given question. Changes the visualization in the question edit page will be specific to that question.</p>

<h4 id="14">What happens when I publish a survey?</h4>
<p>The survey will be made available for completion in the specified time frame. The published survey will follow the state of the design at the time of publication, and it is accessible through a shareable link.</p>

<h4 id="15">What are the opening and closing times of a survey?</h4>
<p>A survey may only be completed between its opening time and its closing time.</p>

<h4 id="16">What does the status of a survey mean?</h4>
<p>A survey’s status can be “pending,” “in-progress,” or “closed.” “Pending” means the opening date/time is still in the future and the survey has not opened for completion yet. “In-progress” means it is currently open. “Closed” means the closing date/time has passed and the survey is no longer open for completion.</p>
