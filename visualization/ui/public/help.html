    <h4>Uploading an Image</h4>
    <p>You may upload a raster image, of which the file types JPEG and PNG are supported, or a vector image, of which the file type SVG is supported. CAUTION: Importing a new image overwrites all changes.</p>
    
    <h4>The "Highlight" Tool</h4>
    <p>Click on an element to highlight it. A highlighted element will appear highlighted to a survey participant if they are not expected to leave a response directly on the visual. This is helpful for drawing attention to an element for a short answer or multiple choice type question.</p>

    <h4>The "Set Selectable" Tool</h4>
    <p>For an element to be selectable means it can be selected in response to a question if the question type allows it. Elements that are highlighted dark blue are selectable, cyan are not selectable. Click on an element to toggle its selectability.</p>

    <h4>The "Create" Tool</h4>
    <p>Click and drag to draw an interactive box. The box will be invisible unless it is selectable and a user hovers their mouse over it, or if the box is highlighted. The box is selectable by default.</p>

    <h4>The "Delete" Tool</h4>
    <p>Click on box created using the "create" tool to delete it.</p>

    <h4>Exporting</h4>
    <p>The visualization is saved in SVG format. Click export to download the visualization as an SVG file.</p>
