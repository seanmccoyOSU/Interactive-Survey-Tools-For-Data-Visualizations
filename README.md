# Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a custom web-based survey tool that allows researchers at Oregon State University (or other
organizations) to create interactive surveys featuring advanced data visualizations. Unlike existing platforms like Qualtrics, this tool supports dynamic elements such as zooming, panning, and selecting regions on visual assets like SVGs, allowing researchers to gather more nuanced and insightful data and responses. The platform emphasizes usability, accessibility, and data security, aiming to enhance both the researcher and participant experience while addressing the limitations of current survey tools.

# Quick Testing Guide for Your Local Machine
### Launching
Rename the file `.env` for later use.

Run `mv .env.local .env`.

Run `docker compose up --build` to run the application. This may take a while. Visit `http://localhost:5000/` and `http://localhost:8000/` to verify.

Note: the command `sed -i 's/\r$//' wait-for.sh` may be helpful if you have trouble launching.

### Cleaning
Run `docker compose down` to clean up after you've tested.
